#  üöóüîã Electric_Vehicle_Data_Analysis_By_Using_Tableau


### üìò Project Overview
This project offers a comprehensive analysis of the Electric Vehicle (EV) market using Tableau, focusing on trends by model, make, state, and model year. Designed for stakeholders interested in the EV industry, the dashboard highlights key insights like popular brands, geographic adoption, and the shift from Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) to Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs). 

### üåü Project Goals
1. Analyze and visualize the growth and distribution of EVs.
2. Identify leading EV manufacturers and popular models.
3. Understand consumer preferences across various geographies.
4. Explore the impact of CAFV (Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle) eligibility on EV adoption.


### üìä Key Features and Visualizations

1. **Average Electric Range**:
   - Visualizes the typical electric range by make and model, allowing comparison across brands. This insight is crucial for identifying manufacturers with higher battery efficiency.

2. **Top 10 Vehicle Manufacturers by Total Count**:
   - Highlights the top 10 EV manufacturers in terms of total vehicles, providing a clear view of market leaders.

3. **Total BEV and PHEV Distribution**:
   - Compares Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) with Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs), showing trends in consumer preferences and shifts towards fully electric models.

4. **Total Vehicles by CAFV Eligibility**:
   - Breakdown of vehicles eligible for Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle incentives. This insight can be valuable for understanding the effects of policy incentives on EV adoption rates.

5. **Total Vehicles by Model**:
   - Distribution of total vehicles by model, identifying popular EV models and trends among consumers.

6. **Total Vehicles by Model Year**:
   - Analyzes the adoption of EVs over time, showing growth trends and changes in consumer preferences with each model year.

7. **Total Vehicles by State**:
   - Geographic distribution of EVs across states, indicating regions with higher adoption rates. This visualization helps identify where EV infrastructure might be more developed or where there is higher policy support.


### üõ†Ô∏è Data Preparation & Processing

- **Data Cleaning**: Removed duplicates, corrected formatting issues, and standardized model names to ensure consistency.
- **Calculated Fields**: Created metrics like `Total Vehicles`, `Average Electric Range`, and categorical fields for BEV and PHEV classifications.
- **Data Aggregation**: Aggregated data by make, model, and model year to ensure a clean and accurate visualization.
  

### üñ•Ô∏è Dashboard Design and Interactivity

- **Interactive Filters**: Users can filter by model year, vehicle type (BEV or PHEV), and state to drill down into specific segments.
- **KPI Metrics**: Key metrics such as total vehicles, average electric range, and top 10 manufacturers are prominently displayed.
- **Layout**: The dashboard is designed for readability, with a logical flow from high-level insights (total vehicle counts) to detailed breakdowns by region, model, and eligibility.


### üîç Insights & Findings

1. **Top EV Brands and Models**:
   - Certain brands and models are consistently more popular, indicating a strong market presence and consumer trust in these brands.

2. **Growing Popularity of BEVs**:
   - BEVs show an upward trend compared to PHEVs, suggesting increased consumer confidence in fully electric options, possibly due to improvements in battery technology and charging infrastructure.

3. **Influence of CAFV Eligibility**:
   - A notable number of vehicles meet CAFV eligibility standards, showing how policy incentives might influence consumer decisions and drive EV adoption.

4. **Regional Adoption Patterns**:
   - Certain states show significantly higher EV adoption, potentially due to local incentives, better infrastructure, and environmental policies. This can guide future investment in EV infrastructure.


### üöÄ How to Use

1. **Open in Tableau**: Load the `.twbx` file in Tableau Desktop.
2. **Explore the Dashboard**: Use the filters to explore data by model year, make, model, and state.
3. **Analyze Trends**: Gain insights into the EV market and observe trends across different metrics.


### üß∞ Technologies Used

- **Tableau**: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **Data Cleaning Tools**: Ensured data quality through preprocessing before importing into Tableau.


### üìà Future Scope

- **Extended Analysis**: Add more data on charging station availability or energy consumption for a more holistic view of EV usage.
- **Real-Time Data Integration**: Connect with real-time EV registration databases to keep the dashboard up-to-date.
- **Predictive Insights**: Use historical data to predict future EV adoption rates by state and model year.
